# PDF_Data_Mine
This Powershell Script combs through PDF files, retrieves information from those files and created an excel document with that data.

This script runs as admin and allows you to comb through a folder full of PDFs and extract desired information. Simply type in the key words to look for and give it the file path and the script does the rest. The script can also be edited for formatting preferences.

The .zip provides all files required to make this work. Simply create "C:\ps" and place all files in this location. Unzip and get to searching PDFs!
